## Features

### Ping
ICMP round-trip latency measurement with real-time streaming results.
- Configurable probe count (1–50 via slider; default configurable up to 100 in Settings), timeout (100–30,000 ms), and packet size (1–65,507 bytes)
- Per-probe RTT reporting with sequence numbers and status (SUCCESS / TIMEOUT / ERROR)
- Live stats panel during active ping: packet loss %, min, avg, and max RTT updating after every packet
- RTT chart with Y-axis ms labels and fill gradient, rendered as results arrive
- **Continuous mode** — toggle replaces the count slider; pings indefinitely while the app is on screen, screen kept on automatically, stops when backgrounded or screen locked
  - Rolling window of the last 100 packets drives live stats and chart
  - Full session log streamed to a temp CSV file; shareable via the Share button on completion
- Recent hosts saved per-session and offered as quick-select chips

### Traceroute
Network path analysis with per-hop geolocation enrichment.
- Configurable max hops (1–64), timeout (500–30,000 ms), and probes per hop (1–5)
- Dual protocol support: ICMP and UDP
- Automatic MTU discovery or custom packet size (28–1,472 bytes)
- Each hop shows IP address, reverse-DNS hostname, RTT, and geographic location

### Port Scanner
TCP port reachability scanning with service identification.
- 7 preset port groups: Common Services, Well-Known (1–1024), Web, Databases, Mail, Remote Access, and Custom range (up to 10,000 ports)
- Concurrent scanning (1–500 simultaneous probes), per-port timeout (100–30,000 ms)
- Service name resolution and banner grabbing for open ports

### LAN Scanner
Local network device discovery across IPv4 subnets.
- CIDR subnet scanning (/16–/30) with automatic current-subnet detection
- Per-host details: IP, reverse-DNS hostname, MAC address, OUI vendor name, open ports, RTT, gateway flag
- Concurrent host probes (1–500) with real-time progress streaming and final summary
- Search results by IP, hostname, or vendor; filter by gateway or hosts with open ports

### DNS Lookup
Full DNS record resolution with multiple resolver options.
- 10 record types: A, AAAA, MX, TXT, CNAME, NS, SOA, PTR, SRV, CAA
- Resolver options: system default, Google (8.8.8.8), Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), or custom server
- PTR queries auto-reverse IPv4 addresses to `.in-addr.arpa` and IPv6 to `.ip6.arpa` form — just enter the IP
- Returns resolved records, query time, and raw DNS response

### Wi-Fi Scanner
Wi-Fi environment analysis and channel optimization.
- Access point discovery with RSSI signal strength, sorted by signal
- Per-channel congestion analysis across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands
- Connected network live info and best-channel recommendations (least-congested channels 1, 6, or 11 on 2.4 GHz)

### TLS Inspector
SSL/TLS certificate chain analysis for any TCP host.
- Configurable host, port (default 443), and timeout (500–30 000 ms)
- Full certificate chain: leaf, intermediates, and root
- Per-certificate: subject/issuer CN & org, validity dates, SANs, serial number, signature algorithm, public key algorithm & bit length, SHA-256 fingerprint
- Connection summary: TLS version, cipher suite, handshake time, chain trust status
- Highlights expired certificates and self-signed certs
- Works with any TCP host, not just HTTPS — does not send an HTTP request

### Network Topology Discovery
SNMP-based network topology discovery via BFS traversal.
- Seed IP discovery using SNMP v1, v2c, or v3 with configurable community string / credentials
- Neighbours discovered via LLDP (IEEE 802.1AB) and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
- Per-node data: sysDescr, sysName, sysLocation, uptime, vendor, model, firmware version
- Interface enumeration with speed, MAC address, and operational status (UP/DOWN)
- VLAN discovery via Cisco VTP MIB and IEEE 802.1Q standard MIB
- Interactive force-layout canvas with pan/zoom gestures and node detail bottom sheet
- Configurable max hops (1–10), timeout, and SNMP v3 auth/priv protocols (MD5/SHA, DES/AES128)

### WHOIS Lookup
Domain and IP registration lookup via three-hop WHOIS referral chain.
- Supports domain names, IPv4, IPv6, and ASN queries
- Three-hop chain for domains: IANA referral → TLD registry → registrar
- Two-hop chain for IPs/ASNs: ARIN → referred RIR if needed
- Static TLD fallback map for common TLDs (.com, .net, .org, .io, .co.uk, .de, .fr, .app, .dev)
- Parsed fields: registrar, registration/expiry/update dates, name servers, WHOIS status codes, DNSSEC, registrant org & country
- Human-readable status code labels (e.g. "clientTransferProhibited" → "Transfer Locked")
- Live relay-chain visualiser: animates each server node PENDING → QUERYING → DONE as the chain progresses
- Optional raw response per hop for power users

### HTTP Probe
Full HTTP/HTTPS request tester with security header analysis.
- Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS methods
- Custom request headers: add/remove key-value pairs dynamically
- Request body editor (enabled for POST, PUT, PATCH) with monospace text input
- Follow-redirects toggle with full redirect chain display
- Response display across four tabs:
  - **Overview**: status code (color-coded 2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx), response time, final URL, redirect hops, body size, Content-Type
  - **Headers**: collapsible request and response header sections
  - **Body**: scrollable monospace response body with copy-to-clipboard; truncated at 512 KB with notice
  - **Security**: per-header pass/warn/fail ratings for HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and Server header information disclosure

### mDNS Service Browser
LAN service discovery via multicast DNS (RFC 6762 / DNS-SD RFC 6763).
- Discovers all advertised services on the local network without prior knowledge of service types
- Two-phase discovery: enumerates service types via `_services._dns-sd._udp.local.`, then instances per type, then SRV/TXT/A/AAAA records per instance
- Supported service examples: `_http._tcp`, `_airplay._tcp`, `_ipp._tcp`, `_homekit._tcp`, `_spotify-connect._tcp`, and any other DNS-SD service
- Per-service details: display name, hostname, port, IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), and TXT record key-value pairs
- Live streaming results: services appear as they are discovered, grouped by service type with animated list entries
- Expandable service items show full TXT record details on tap
- Configurable scan duration (8-second window); scan can be stopped at any time
- Requires Wi-Fi multicast lock (`CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE`) for reliable reception on Android

### Subnet Calculator
IPv4 subnet calculator with visual binary breakdown and multi-notation conversion.
- Two input modes: **CIDR / Mask** and **IP Range** (finds the tightest subnet covering a given min–max IP pair)
- CIDR mode accepts CIDR (`192.168.1.0/24`), dot-decimal mask (`192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0`), space-separated mask, or bare IP (assumes `/32`)
- Computes: network address, broadcast, first/last usable host, total and usable host counts
- **Binary Breakdown card**: colour-coded bit grid distinguishing network bits (blue) from host bits (orange) for IP address, subnet mask, and network address rows
- **Notation Equivalents card**: CIDR, dot-decimal mask, wildcard mask, hex mask (`0xFFFFFF00`), and binary mask
- **Address Properties card**: IP class (A/B/C/D/E), private/public scope badge (RFC 1918 + loopback + link-local), prefix and host bit counts
- Quick example chips for common subnets (`/8`, `/12`, `/16`, `/24`, `/30`, `/0`)
- Network alignment warning when the entered IP is not on a network boundary, showing the corrected network address
